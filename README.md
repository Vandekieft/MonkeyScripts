# MonkeyScripts
A spot for my UserScripts that I have for Violent Monkey

# Get YouTube Channel URLs

Adds 2 menu items in the User-Script extension menu when on a YouTube Channel
 - Load Channel URLs 
   - Which is essentially just a force refresh of the page as YouTube may have pre-loaded and this will grab the current page channel
 - Show loaded Channel URLS
   - This will display a info box with the found channel URLs on the channel page and allow you to Copy them

## Usage and Installation

To use this userscript, you will need a userscript manager extension installed in your browser. This script has been tested on the Violentmonkeyv2.13.11 extension for Firefox.

> Prerequisites: Install a userscript manager extension in your browser (if you don't have one already). I prefer [Violent Monkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) | [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) or [Chormium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)

Method 1:
* Head over to [The Greasy Fork script page](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/460715-copy-youtube-channel-id), and click install

Method 2:
* Open the userscript manager dashboard and create a new userscript.
* Copy and paste the script into the userscript editor, or paste the RAW url in "Install from URL". 
   - RAW url ->[Copy YouTube Channel ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vandekieft/MonkeyScripts/main/CopyYouTubeChannelID.txt)
* Save the userscript and refresh the YouTube page.
